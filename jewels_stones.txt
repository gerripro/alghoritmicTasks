You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing the stones you have. Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

class Solution {
  int numJewelsInStones(String jewels, String stones) {
  Map <String, int> eachStoneCount = {};
  eachStoneCount = countLetters(stones);
  
  int jewelsCount = 0;
  for (int i=0; i<jewels.length; i++) {
    var jewel = jewels[i];
    if (eachStoneCount[jewel] != null){
    jewelsCount += eachStoneCount[jewel]!;}
  }
  return jewelsCount;
}

Map<String, int> countLetters(String input) {
  Map<String, int> letterCountMap = {};

  for (int i = 0; i < input.length; i++) {
    String ch = input[i];
      letterCountMap[ch] = (letterCountMap[ch] ?? 0) + 1;
  }

  return letterCountMap;
}
